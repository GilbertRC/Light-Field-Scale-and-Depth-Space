# Light Field Scale and Depth Space
A simple reproduced version of Light Field Scale and Depth Space (Lisad)

&bull; Lisad-1 can be used to detect 3D keypoints as the ray edge detection (edge detection) in EPI.
<br>
&bull; Lisad-2 can be used to estimate the depth map as the ray detection (blob detection) in EPI.

### Demo:

3D keypoints detection (hotter is closer)
